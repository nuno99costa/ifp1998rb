This git repository holds my solutions to the exercises in the book Introduction to Functional Programming by Richard Bird (1998)

I made this repository because, while solving these exercises, I couldnt find a source with solutions, only to the earlier version of the book for Haskell

The exercises are either solved in Haskell, or in txt format

Any feedback, corrections and comments are appreciated
