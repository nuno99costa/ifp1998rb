The two definitions of pred are equivalent.

Both have the first line:
    pred 0 = 0
    pred n = 0, if n = 0 => pred 0 = 0

They also share the same process of pattern matching:
    pred (n + 1) = n => pred n = n - 1
    pred n = n - 1, if n > 0 (n > 0 is there just so this pattern doesn't match with n = 0)
